                    <p> When you only want a glass of wine, why should you compromise? Simon and Ben were inspired to
                        launch Canned Wine Co. in 2019 to deliver a better choice to customers for single serve wine.
                        Quality wines that deliver an experience, connect you to the people and place they come from,
                        and give you a better choice of what to drink. All of this could be delivered in a way
                        that didnâ€™t cost the planet.</p>
